# 01 Code Refactor Challenge: HoriSEOn Digital Marketing Website

## Description

In this module, we focused on refactoring an existing application. The goal was to improve the codebase by implementing best practices and optimizing the application's structure. By applying HTML, CSS, and Git skills, we enhanced the readability, maintainability, and performance of the code. The refactored application now aligns with industry standards and demonstrates our proficiency in code organization and optimization.

## User Story

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
